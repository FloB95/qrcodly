description: Learn how to use your own domain for QR code short links
---

Use your own domain (like `links.yourbusiness.com`) instead of the default QRcodly domain for your dynamic QR codes. This keeps your brand consistent and gives you full control over your short URLs.

<Callout type="info">
	Custom domains require a **Pro Plan**. [View pricing](/pricing) to learn more about upgrading.
</Callout>

## Why Use a Custom Domain?

- **Brand Recognition**: Your short URLs will use your own domain, making them instantly recognizable
- **Trust**: People are more likely to scan QR codes that lead to familiar domains
- **Full Control**: Keep ownership of your links even if you switch QR code providers
- **Professional Look**: Perfect for business cards, marketing materials, and product packaging

## Before You Start

You'll need:

1. A **Pro Plan** subscription
2. Access to your domain's **DNS settings** (usually in your domain registrar like GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.)
3. A **subdomain** to use (e.g., `links.yourdomain.com`, `qr.yourdomain.com`)

<Callout type="warn">
	Only subdomains are supported (like `links.example.com`). You cannot use a root domain (like
	`example.com`) or multi-level subdomains (like `qr.links.example.com`).
</Callout>

## Step 1: Go to Domain Settings

1. Log in to your QRcodly account
2. Click on your **profile image** in the top right corner of the header
3. Click on **Domains** in the settings sidebar

Or simply go directly to [Settings → Domains](/settings/domains).

You'll see the domains management page where you can add and manage your custom domains.

## Step 2: Add Your Domain

1. Click the **Add Domain** button
2. Enter your subdomain (e.g., `links.yourbusiness.com`)
3. Click **Add** to register the domain

After adding your domain, QRcodly will provide you with DNS records that you need to configure.

## Step 3: Configure DNS Records

You'll need to add two DNS records in your domain registrar's DNS settings:

### TXT Record (Ownership Verification)

This record proves you own the domain.

| Type | Name/Host        | Value                            |
| ---- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| TXT  | `_qrcodly.links` | `qrcodly-verification=abc123...` |

<Callout type="info">
	The exact name and value will be shown in QRcodly after you add your domain. Copy them exactly as
	displayed.
</Callout>

### CNAME Record (Traffic Routing)

This record directs traffic from your subdomain to QRcodly's servers.

| Type  | Name/Host | Value               |
| ----- | --------- | ------------------- |
| CNAME | `links`   | `custom.qrcodly.de` |

<Callout type="warn">
	The **Name/Host** field should only contain the subdomain part (e.g., `links`), not the full
	domain. Some providers may require the full subdomain — check your provider's documentation.
</Callout>

### DNS Provider Examples

#### Cloudflare

1. Go to your domain in Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Click **DNS** in the sidebar
3. Click **Add Record**
4. For the TXT record: Select "TXT", enter the name and value from QRcodly
5. For the CNAME record: Select "CNAME", enter the subdomain name, set content to `custom.qrcodly.de`
6. **Important**: Set the Proxy status to **DNS only** (grey cloud) for the CNAME record

#### GoDaddy

1. Go to your domain's DNS Management
2. Click **Add** under the Records section
3. For TXT: Select "TXT" type, enter the host and value from QRcodly
4. For CNAME: Select "CNAME" type, enter the subdomain as host, and `custom.qrcodly.de` as the value
5. Save your changes

#### Namecheap

1. Go to Domain List and click **Manage** next to your domain
2. Click **Advanced DNS**
3. Click **Add New Record**
4. Add both TXT and CNAME records with the values from QRcodly
5. Save all changes

## Step 4: Verify Your Domain

After configuring DNS records, go back to QRcodly:

1. Find your domain in the list
2. Click the **menu icon** (three dots)
3. Select **Verify** or **Setup Instructions** to check the status

QRcodly will check if your DNS records are correctly configured. This verification can take a few minutes to a few hours depending on DNS propagation.

### Verification Phases

| Phase            | Status        | What it means                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| DNS Verification | Pending       | Waiting for TXT and CNAME records to be detected |
| DNS Verification | Partial (1/2) | One record verified, one still pending           |
| SSL Setup        | Pending       | DNS verified, now setting up SSL certificate     |
| Ready            | Active        | Domain is fully configured and ready to use      |

<Callout type="info">
	DNS changes can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours to propagate worldwide. If
	verification fails, wait a bit and try again.
</Callout>

## Step 5: Set as Default

Once your domain is verified, set it as your default domain so it will be used for all new dynamic QR codes:

1. Click the **menu icon** next to your domain
2. Select **Set as Default**

<Callout type="warn">
	This step is important! Only after setting your custom domain as default will new dynamic QR codes
	automatically use it for their short URLs.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### DNS records not detected

- **Wait longer**: DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours
- **Check for typos**: Make sure you copied the values exactly as shown in QRcodly
- **Verify record type**: Ensure you're using TXT (not A) and CNAME (not A or AAAA)
- **Check the host field**: Some providers want just the subdomain (`links`), others want the full name (`links.example.com`)

### SSL certificate pending

- SSL certificates are automatically issued after DNS verification
- This usually takes a few minutes but can occasionally take longer
- If it's been more than an hour, try clicking **Verify** again

### Domain shows error status

- Check if your domain registrar has any restrictions on CNAME records
- Make sure the CNAME record isn't proxied (Cloudflare users: use DNS-only mode)
- Contact support if the issue persists

### Existing QR codes not using new domain

- QR codes created before adding your custom domain will keep their original URLs
- To use your custom domain, edit the QR code and select your domain from the dropdown
- Or create a new QR code with your custom domain selected
