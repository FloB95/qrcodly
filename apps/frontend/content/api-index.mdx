description: Get started with the QRcodly API

---

Welcome to the **QRcodly API documentation** 👋
This guide will help you get started with the API, generate your API key, and understand plan limitations.

## Overview

The QRcodly API allows you to programmatically generate and manage QR codes using the same engine that powers **qrcodly.de**.
It is designed to be simple, fast, and scalable for both small projects and production use cases.

The API is fully documented using **OpenAPI** and can be integrated into any modern backend or frontend stack.

## Step 1: Download the OpenAPI Specification

QRcodly provides an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification that you can import into tools like:

* Postman
* Insomnia
* ... other API Clients

You can download the specification here:

```
https://www.qrcodly.de/api/v1/openapi.json
```

  <strong>Tip</strong><br />
  Importing the OpenAPI file into Postman or other API Clients is the fastest way to explore and test the API.

## Step 2: Create an API Key

To authenticate requests, you need an **API key**.

### How to create an API key

1. Log in to your QRcodly account
2. Click on the **profile icon** in the top-right corner
3. Select **Manage account**
4. Navigate to **API Keys**
5. Create a new API key

<Callout type="warning">
  <p>Keep your API key secret. Do not expose it in public repositories or client-side code.</p>
  
  <p>Your API key is shown <strong>only once</strong> during creation and cannot be viewed again.
  Make sure to store it securely (for example in a password manager or environment variables).
  If the key is lost or compromised, you must generate a new one.</p>
</Callout>
Once created, include the API key in your requests as required by the API documentation.

## Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated using your API key.

Usage:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
